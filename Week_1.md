# Week 1: Menus

Menus are an ubiquitous feature in web design. They allow users to navigate from one page to another, and can convey a sense of relative importance and hierarchy of content. 

As explained in the README, this lesson will consist of visual and web design assignments. You should complete the visual design component before beginning the web design one.

I've found that I learn the most about web design when I try to emulate the work of others. To that end, this lesson will not require you to create your own designs; rather, you will find existing ones you admire on the web, and attempt to recreate them.

### Getting Started

1. Create a folder called "Week_1" and push it to a new repository on Github. You will put all of your design, HTML and CSS files in this folder. 
2. Send me the link to the repository; if you want me to check your progress at any time, I'll be able to see what you've accomplished thus far.

### Visual

1. Create a folder within your Week_1 folder called "Visual". 
2. Research the web for different examples of menus used by eCommerce, social media, and personal websites.
2. Pick two menu types that you would like to emulate, take screenshots, and create basic wireframes of them. Once you finish your wireframes, take photos of them and include those in your Visual folder along with the screenshots. Avoid fancy menus that use complicated animations or custom images--we'll get into those topics in later lessons.
3. (Optional) To aid with the CSS you will create later, create medium-fidelity mockups of the menus of your choosing, identifying size, color, margins, text, etc.


### Web

Now that you have developed an understanding of the design specifications of your chosen menus, it's time to create them! There are a number of different ways to create menus on the web, some of them [harder to learn than others](http://www.paulund.co.uk/css-flexbox). I've listed some resources below that may help you begin. Remember, if you don't understand an aspect of what you're reading, make sure to stop, Google it and learn the basics before continuing.

* [Spacing](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/m/margin/)
* [Flexbox](http://www.paulund.co.uk/css-flexbox)

I suggest creating a "Web" folder within Week_1 to help separate your visual and web design documents. It will be easiest if you create separate HTML and CSS files for each design.

**Hyperlinks**  
After you finish a design, you can make the menu interaction more realistic by including [hyperlinks](). These can simply direct to blank pages, or a modified version of your menu code (hint: think about changing HTML classes or ids to reflect the current page).

### Submission

Send me the link to your Github repository when you are finished. I'll check out your design process and code, and give you feedback.
