# Week 2: Grids

Grid systems are so popular in web design that a number of [different](http://foundation.zurb.com/) [frameworks](http://getbootstrap.com/) exist to support formatting in a grid fashion. Most of them use special CSS classes that split a website into 12 columns which can be allocated differently depending on screen size. 

This lesson is not intended to teach you about popular grid systems or how to use them. Instead, you will learn how to organize content for your own portfolio site. Most portfolio websites take advantage of grids because they're a convenient way to present a series of photos. 

You want visitors to your website to be able to click on those photos and have something happen, so common click functionality includes showing a [lightbox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/demo/) or linking to a more detailed project page. 

### Getting Started

1. Create a folder called "Week_2" and push it to a new repository on Github. You will put all of your design, HTML and CSS files in this folder. If you're tired of creating new repositories for each week's lesson, you can group them all into one folder with a subfolder for each week and just push that.
2. Send me the link to the repository; if you want me to check your progress at any time, I'll be able to see what you've accomplished thus far.

### Visual

1. Create a folder within your Week_2 folder called "Visual". 
2. Wireframe two different types of grids you might use for a portfolio site. Take photos of your wireframes and add them to the Visual folder.
3. Look online for two portfolio sites that use a different style of grid than you wireframed. Take screenshots of these grids and add them to the Visual folder.

### Web

After designing / finding some grids, it's time to figure out how to make them. Some of the skills you may have picked up last week will help, but there's still a lot to learn regarding positioning and sizing of boxes.

Grids are commonly sized using px, %, [viewport units](https://web-design-weekly.com/2014/11/18/viewport-units-vw-vh-vmin-vmax/), or some [combination](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc) of the three. A nifty way to organize rows and columns uses something called [flexbox](http://www.paulund.co.uk/css-flexbox), but you can also rely on the units listed above, floats, and margins.

If you're interested in making your grids more realistic, you can include images using the ```<img>``` tag, and hyperlinks to other pages.

Put all of your web design work into a folder called "Web" to separate it from "Visual".

Tip: You may be tempted to use the CSS ```border``` property to mark your grid boxes. Just keep in mind that CSS borders are outset by default, which means they may throw off your alignment.

### Submission

Send me the link to your Github repository when you are finished. I'll check out your design process and code, and give you feedback.
