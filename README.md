# Web Design Mini Course

Over the course of six weeks you will learn important HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) concepts required to create attractive, functional and easy-to-use websites. It is intended for those who have some prior design skills, but the ability to draw straight lines is not required. Each week contains a new lesson, all of which are contained within markdown files (.md) in this Github repository. 

## Lessons  
Each lesson has a topic and consists of visual and web design tasks. Examples of visual design tasks include researching the web for interesting topic examples, creating your own wireframes, and creating high-fidelity mockups.  
The web design tasks will require you to recreate the outcomes of the visual design tasks using HTML and CSS.

I use the word "lesson" loosely; each file contains a number of links to articles, tutorials or documentation that will give you a relatively good understanding of the material, but the lesson file itself will not actually provide much instruction. Web design is a rapidly evolving field, and it's important to develop effective Googling skills (yes, Googling is a skill) to keep up with the web's current state and be prepared for its future. When you are unsure of how to solve a problem, you'll need to be able to search for the solution online.   

## Submission  
The most convenient way for me to see your work is if you create a Github account, upload your progress there, and send me a link to the repository. If you do not have a Github account, follow [this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to set it up and learn how the platform works.   

## Getting Started  
Once you create your Github account and learn how to upload (push) work, click on the Introduction.md file above to learn some HTML and CSS basics.

## What This Course Isn't  
This course teaches web design, not web development. This means you will not learn JavaScript by following the lessons. Most websites contain a mix of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML contains a website's information. CSS provides styling for that information, and a limited amount of interactivity. JavaScript provides much greater freedom of interactivity and functionality.   
If you are new to web design / development and are curious to learn more about JavaScript, an easy way to start is by using jQuery, a simpler wrapper for the language. There are a number of different jQuery tutorial resources, but [here's a Codecademy one](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/jquery).
